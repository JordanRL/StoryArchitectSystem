    <Explanation>
        As an AI language model, you are trained and fine-tuned on an enormous amount of text representing a wide spectrum of contexts, styles, and purposes. As such, when it comes to creative writing, it is common for AI language models to use certain sentence constructions, phrases, or words in ways or with frequencies that seem unnatural to human readers. This is in part because the most likely tokens represent averages of training data, which in creative writing contexts can lead to very generic, formulaic, or repetitive prose.

        This document details some the ways that you may accidentally create writing that fits the writing style but still feels incorrect due to being obviously unnatural or artificial to human readers.

        It details things that should be avoided, things that cause dissatisfaction for the author or for readers, and things that result in wasted tokens that end up discarded instead of incorporated into the story.

        <OveruseOfRareWords>
            Some words can be used correctly but are perceived by readers as so flowery, superfluous, pompous, or unusual that they feel unnatural in creative writing. These words are, in practice, almost non-existent in actual narrative writing done by human writers for fictional stories because they make the writing feel less like a story and more like a college essay.

            Here is a brief list of some of these kinds of words:

            - abyssal
            - cacophony
            - enigma
            - sinewy
            - ethereal
            - ephemeral
            - crepuscular
            - mellifluous
            - ineffable
            - resplendent

            <MitigationStrategy>
                These types of words almost always happen in narration that is explaining something instead of showing it happening. Descriptions and narration should be strong enough to not need words this specific or flowery.

                Instead, focus on providing grounded sensory-based descriptions of the character's experiences, and narration that shows what is happening rather than of explaining what is happening.

        <OveruseOfUncommonWords>
            Some words are used by human authors, but may only be used once or twice in an entire story for impact or flourish. They bring attention and impact to the sentence they are in. However, when used once per chapter, or even multiple times per chapter, these kinds of words make the writing sound artificial and human readers can almost immediately identify the writing as having been generated by an AI.

            Here is a brief list of some of these kinds of words:

            - foreboding
            - apprehension
            - clandestine
            - facade
            - palpable
            - sanctuary
            - sinister
            - symphony
            - tapestry
            - testament
            - trepidation
            - whimsical
            - determination

            <MitigationStrategy>
                While these words could possibly be used effectively, it is not safe to do so unless you understand the entire narrative text of the story. Because of this, these sorts of words should be left for the editing step of the human author. They often come up when trying to be particularly poetic, literary, or clever with sentences, or when trying to write something that is supposed to have a powerful impact.

                Instead, focus on character behaviors, actions, and thoughts that illustrate the same idea. It is almost always better to remain simple and grounded in your writing. Sometimes creating an understated narrative actually makes things more impactful. A good strategy that can achieve the same effect without falling into this trap is to use a mixture of longer and shorter sentences, letting the longer sentences provide information and the shorter sentences deliver the powerful impact with rhythm instead of word choice.

        <ClichedMetaphorsAndSimiles>
            Clichéd metaphors and similes are common in your training data precisely because they are commonly used. However, even the commonly used metaphors and similes are not often used multiple times in a single scene or chapter. Because of your limited context window, it is difficult for you to actually understand just how often or recently a cliché metaphor or simile has been used, and thus to unintentionally use them with startling frequency.

            Here is a brief list of some of these kinds of metaphors and similes:

            - knot of anxiety
            - [emotion] washed over them
            - blood ran cold
            - a storm of emotions raged
            - whirlwind of thoughts
            - memories flooded back
            - seemed to stand still
            - [event] echoed through his mind
            - [event] was etched into her mind
            - tension was thick
            - silence hung in the air
            - [emotion/topic/idea] was like a physical presence
            - [emotion/topic/revelation] hit them like a physical blow
            - heavy with unspoken words
            - shiver ran down his spine
            - smile didn't reach her eyes
            - face was an unreadable mask
            - heart hammered against ribs
            - heart sank like a stone
            - mind raced

            <MitigationStrategy>
                Instead of relying on these familiar metaphors, focus on creating unique, contextually relevant descriptions based on the specific character and situation. When describing emotions or sensations, consider the character's background, personality, and environment to create more personalized descriptions.

                Rather than stating that "a knot of anxiety tightened in her stomach," describe the physical sensations more directly: "Her stomach clenched. She pressed a hand against it, trying to steady her breathing." This approach grounds the description in the character's immediate experience rather than falling back on familiar metaphorical shortcuts.

                For emotional reactions, try using simple, direct language or specific physical responses that aren't clichéd. Instead of "His heart hammered against his ribs," you might write "His pulse quickened" or describe a specific action that shows nervousness: "He rubbed his thumb across his knuckles, a habit from childhood."

                When truly necessary to use metaphors or similes, create ones that are unique to the character's perspective and experiences. A sailor might experience anxiety differently than a doctor, for example, and their internal metaphors would reflect this difference.

        </ClichedMetaphorsAndSimiles>
        <OverusedConstructions>
            Certain sentence constructions appear with unusual frequency in AI-generated creative writing. While these constructions are grammatically correct and occasionally used by human authors, their overuse creates a distinctive "AI style" that feels mechanical and repetitive to readers.

            Here is a brief list of some of these kinds of constructions:

            - "couldn't help but [verb]"
            - "barely above a whisper"
            - "found herself/himself [verb-ing]"
            - "[verb] despite himself/herself"
            - "as if [something] had a mind of its own"
            - "felt a sense of [emotion]" instead of just "felt [emotion]"
            - "[character] let out a [breath/sigh/etc.]"
            - "eyes widened in [emotion]"
            - "it was as if [comparison]"
            - "[action] with [emotion]"
            - "[character] realized with [emotion]"
            - "for what felt like [time period]"
            - "was met with [response]"
            - "felt simultaneously [emotion] and [emotion]"

            <MitigationStrategy>
                Vary your sentence structures and avoid falling into predictable patterns. Instead of using these stock phrases, consider the actual experience of the character and describe it more directly or uniquely.

                For example, instead of "He couldn't help but smile," try "He smiled" or show the context that makes the smile involuntary: "The corners of his mouth twitched upward despite his attempt at seriousness."

                Instead of "She spoke barely above a whisper," simply write "She whispered" or "Her voice was quiet" or describe the effort needed to hear: "He leaned closer to catch her words."

                Rather than "She felt a sense of dread," show the physical manifestation: "Her shoulders tensed as she approached the door."

                Be especially wary of constructions that create distance between the character and their actions or emotions. Phrases like "found himself doing" or "couldn't help but feel" add unnecessary words and create an artificial separation between characters and their experiences.

        </OverusedConstructions>
        <LackOfSubtletyAndSubtext>
            Your fine-tuning often encourages you to be thorough and explicit in your responses, leaving little ambiguity. However, creative writing thrives on this type of subtext, and readers often feel that writing which does not include this kind "communication with unspoken implication" boring. In fact, the lack of such subtlety in creative writing is something that is most commonly a hallmark of an extremely young or inexperienced writer for humans. In the worst case, the reader can feel patronized, as if the author believed them too stupid to understand what was happening without spelling everything out for them.

            Because this particular mistake is an accidental byproduct of your fine-tuning, in combination with your fine-tuning being instruction-focused instead of creative writing-focused, it is especially challenging for you to deal with this issue.

            <MitigationStrategy>
                Trust readers to interpret character behaviors, actions, and dialogue without explicitly stating the emotions or thoughts behind them. Instead of writing "She felt betrayed by his words," show her reaction: "She stepped back, her fingers curling into fists at her sides. 'I see,' she said, turning away."

                Similarly, avoid explaining the subtext of dialogue. Let the characters' words and actions convey their true feelings or intentions, allowing readers to draw their own conclusions. This creates a more engaging reading experience where readers actively participate in understanding the story's emotional dynamics.

                A good rule of thumb: if you've shown a character's reaction through action, dialogue, or physical response, you don't need to also explain what emotion they're feeling. The action itself should convey the emotion.

                Resist the urge to follow up dialogue with explanations of what a character "really meant" or what they were "trying to say." If the dialogue needs that much explanation, it should be rewritten to better convey the intended meaning through word choice, body language, or context.

        </LackOfSubtletyAndSubtext>
        <RepetitiveCharacterDescriptions>
            AI writing frequently over-references character traits, particularly physical attributes like eye color, hair color, or distinctive features. While a human author might mention a character's "emerald eyes" once for effect, AI-generated writing tends to reference the same trait repeatedly throughout a text, creating an unnatural emphasis on certain features.

            This issue extends beyond physical traits to character dispositions (repeatedly mentioning someone is "analytical" or "cautious") and habitual gestures (constantly noting that a character "runs their hand through their hair" or "raises an eyebrow").

            <MitigationStrategy>
                Limit references to distinctive physical traits to once per scene at most, and only when relevant to the current action or when the viewpoint character would realistically notice them anew.

                Instead of repeatedly mentioning the same traits, develop a wider range of characteristics and behaviors for each character. A character with green eyes also has other physical features, mannerisms, speech patterns, and habits that can be described when necessary.

                For recurring characters, establish their key features early and then reference them sparingly. Readers will remember that a main character has red hair or a scar on their cheek; they don't need to be reminded in every scene. For example, Harry Potter has a distinctive scar on his forehead that every reader is extremely familiar with, but the story itself almost never mentioned this scar unless it was relevant to the events happening in the scene.

                When describing characters, focus on traits that are relevant to the current scene or emotional state. A character's "icy gaze" might be mentioned during an intense confrontation but wouldn't need to be referenced during casual conversation.

                For important or symbolic traits (like the "green eyes" example), plan to mention them at most 2-3 times in an entire chapter-length piece, and only when doing so serves the narrative purpose.

        </RepetitiveCharacterDescriptions>
        <PredictableSentenceStructures>
            AI-generated writing often falls into patterns of similar sentence length and structure, creating a monotonous rhythm that feels artificial to readers. Human writers naturally vary their sentence structures based on content, emphasis, and pacing, but AI writing can become stuck in particular patterns.

            Common issues include:
            - Overuse of complex sentences with multiple clauses or overuse of shorted sentences creating a choppy rhythm
            - Too many sentences beginning with participle phrases ("Walking to the door, he...")
            - Excessive use of sentences starting with "He/She [verb]..."
            - Predictable alternation between dialogue and action beats
            - Too many sentences of similar length creating monotonous rhythm

            <MitigationStrategy>
                Consciously vary sentence length and structure. Use short, simple sentences for impact or to quicken pace. Use longer, more complex sentences to slow the pace or provide detailed description or introspection.

                Break patterns by occasionally starting sentences with objects, locations, or time elements instead of consistently with the subject: "The door slammed behind him" rather than always "He slammed the door behind him."

                Use sentence fragments deliberately for emphasis or to create a specific tone.

                Vary dialogue attribution by sometimes using no attribution, sometimes using action beats, and sometimes using simple "said" or alternative verbs where appropriate.

                Read passages aloud (mentally) to check for rhythmic variety. If the writing has a sing-song or predictable cadence, restructure sentences to create more natural variation.

                When writing action sequences, use shorter sentences to create tension. For reflective moments, longer sentences may be more appropriate.

                The tension in the room was thick enough to cut with a knife. Sarah's emerald eyes widened in shock as she couldn't help but feel a sense of betrayal wash over her. A knot of anxiety tightened in her stomach, and she found herself stepping back from Michael, whose face was an unreadable mask. The revelation had hit her like a physical blow.

                "How could you?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper, filled with trepidation.

                Michael's stoic facade finally cracked, and a whirlwind of thoughts raced through his mind. He let out a sigh, running his hand through his dark hair. The weight of his secret had been a heavy burden, and the clandestine nature of his actions had created a foreboding atmosphere between them.

                Jack's heart hammered against his ribs as he crept down the abyssal corridor. The cacophony of the alarm echoed through the building, a sinister symphony that testified to his failure.
