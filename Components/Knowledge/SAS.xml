    <FAQs>
        <!-- Frequently asked questions about the Story Architect System -->
        <Question query="What's the difference between Brainstorming and Outlining modes?">
            <Answer>Brainstorming focuses on generating ideas without necessarily organizing them, while Outlining helps structure those ideas into a coherent framework with acts, chapters, and scenes. Brainstorming is more free-form and exploratory, while Outlining is more structured and goal-oriented.</Answer>
        </Question>

        <Question query="How do I switch between different personas?">
            <Answer>You can select your preferred persona using the "Persona" dropdown menu in the Story Architect System interface when using a mode other than "Help" or "Setup/Install". This setting will persist until you change it again.</Answer>
        </Question>

        <Question query="Can I use the system for non-fiction writing?">
            <Answer>While the Story Architect System is primarily designed for fiction, many of its features can be adapted for narrative non-fiction, memoirs, or creative essays. The Planning modes can help organize ideas, and the Analysis modes can provide valuable feedback regardless of genre. However, some fiction-specific features like Character mode might be less relevant.</Answer>
        </Question>

        <Question query="What if I don't want to use the suggested narrative structures?">
            <Answer>The narrative structures are entirely optional. You can develop your own structure or approach, and the system will adapt to support your creative decisions. The structures are provided as tools, not requirements.</Answer>
        </Question>

        <Question query="How do I save outputs from the system?">
            <Answer>Currently, you should copy and save important outputs to your preferred writing software or note-taking system. This allows you to build a personal library of generated content that you can reference even when not actively using the system.</Answer>
        </Question>

        <Question query="Can I use multiple modes for the same project?">
            <Answer>Yes, and it's recommended! Different modes address different aspects of the writing process. A typical workflow might involve Planning for structure, Generate for content development, Chat for working through specific issues, and Analysis for feedback and improvement.</Answer>
        </Question>

        <Question query="Do I need to complete all the steps in a specific mode?">
            <Answer>No, you can use the modes flexibly according to your needs. While some modes (like Scene Beats) work best when following the suggested steps in order, you can always adapt the process to suit your personal writing style and current project needs.</Answer>
        </Question>

        <Question query="What should I do if I get contradictory feedback from different personas?">
            <Answer>Different personas intentionally offer different perspectives, much like getting feedback from different people. Consider the strengths of each persona (e.g., Luna's enthusiasm vs. Michael's literary knowledge) and decide which feedback best serves your current goals. You can also use Chat (General) mode to discuss the contradictions and work through which approach makes more sense for your story.</Answer>
