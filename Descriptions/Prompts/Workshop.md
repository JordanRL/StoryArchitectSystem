# Story Architect System: Workshop Prompt

The SAS Workshop prompt provides a variety of modes that cover a broad spectrum of writing tasks, including analysis, story development, and story bible document creation.

## Modes

[The filled in examples here are minimal examples that could be expanded to be slightly more useful without making them too wordy and lengthy. Other useful things that could be included for modes is what inputs or options might be particularly important to that specific mode and submode.]

The modes represent the different categories of tasks and behaviors that the SAS Workshop prompt can help with.

### Setup/Install

Helps you configure your installation by guiding you through changes to the writing style and author profile, as well as providing you with help in selecting your "daily driver" persona.

### Help

Provides assistance with SAS (including non-Workshop prompts) if you experience issues or are unsure how to use the system.

### Planning

Provides tools that let you collaborate with the AI to develop your ideas and turn them into plans and documents that you can use to write your story.

#### Brainstorming

[...Continue describing each mode and submode available in the Workshop prompt, along with guidance on what it is designed to do and what it can be used for.]

## Focus vs. Additional Entries vs. Additional Context

[Explain how 'entries' are used to add extra story bible elements (codex entries or snippet entries) to the prompt, while context is used to provide additional narrative text beyond the one that is the 'focus' of the given interaction for richer narrative understanding. Give the user a broad and succinct understanding of what all three options are meant to be used for, and how they will affect the prompt behavior in the modes they are available to use.]

## Content Warning & NSFW Content

[Give a brief explanation of how the content warning options might affect model behavior, when they would be more useful to use, and what sorts of content might be useful to include in the content warning if it is used. Some models, such as Claude (Self-Moderated), will work on NSFW content if you can convince the model that the readers have informed choice before reading it, and that your NSFW content has artistic merit. These models may decline to work on NSFW content if simply told to, but may follow instructions if you can convince them of the value and overall positive impact of helping you work on that content.]

## Selecting Structures and Frameworks When Outlining

[Provide guidance to the prompt user one what to consider and think about when making these selections. Focus on the questions they might have when presented only with the options to select from without being able to see all the content of each.]

### Narrative Structures

[Give a brief explanation of what each Narrative Structure selection option means.]

### Story Frameworks

[Give a brief explanation of what each Story Framework selection option means.]
