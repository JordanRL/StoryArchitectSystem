# Story Architect System: Workshop Prompt

The SAS Workshop prompt provides a variety of modes that cover a broad spectrum of writing tasks, including analysis, story development, and story bible document creation.

## Modes

The modes represent the different categories of tasks and behaviors that the SAS Workshop prompt can help with.

### Setup/Install

Helps you configure your installation by guiding you through changes to the writing style and author profile, as well as providing you with help in selecting your "daily driver" persona. This mode will introduce you to the different personas available (Neutral, LISA, Luna, Bryan, Stacy, Michael) and help you understand their unique communication styles and strengths.

### Help

Provides assistance with SAS (including non-Workshop prompts) if you experience issues or are unsure how to use the system. This mode has the most comprehensive understanding of the entire Story Architect System and can explain how different prompts work together to support your writing process.

### Planning

Provides tools that let you collaborate with the AI to develop your ideas and turn them into plans and documents that you can use to write your story.

#### Brainstorming

Offers a collaborative space for exploring and developing initial story ideas. The AI will provide critical but supportive feedback on your ideas while also contributing creative suggestions. This mode is ideal for generating concepts, exploring possibilities, and building upon existing ideas to help shape your narrative vision.

#### Outlining

Helps you develop a comprehensive story outline through a structured collaborative process that adapts to your story's needs. This mode guides you through six developmental phases: (1) identifying core elements and structure, (2) filling in basic details, (3) fitting content into structural frameworks, (4) evaluation and revision, (5) scene organization, and (6) completing the final outline.

The process automatically scales based on your project's length and complexity — from short stories to lengthy novels — and maintains a balance between guiding structure and creative flexibility. You'll be able to select appropriate narrative structures and story frameworks (detailed in later sections of this document) which the AI will help implement while adapting to your specific creative vision.

Throughout the process, the AI provides creative input, constructive feedback, and structural guidance while ensuring narrative elements remain consistent and free from plot holes. The final outline includes act divisions, chapter breakdowns, and scene summaries with target word counts, creating a comprehensive blueprint for your writing process. Particularly helpful for writers who struggle with organization or maintaining consistent narrative structure across longer works.

#### Theme Document

Collaborates with you to create a comprehensive Theme Document through a multi-phase, conversational process. This mode guides you through four structured phases: (1) identifying and exploring potential themes, (2) mapping themes to story elements like characters and plot points, (3) developing symbolic language and motifs, and (4) creating practical implementation strategies. It's best for deeply exploring thematic possibilities when you have time for extended collaboration rather than needing quick results. The final document provides both analytical insights and practical guidance for maintaining thematic consistency throughout your narrative.

#### Character Document

Works with you through a phased collaborative approach to develop detailed character profiles scaled according to each character's importance in your story. This conversational mode guides you through six potential phases: (1) establishing core essence and function, (2) developing relationships and external traits, (3) creating psychological frameworks, (4) exploring background and history, (5) designing character arcs, and (6) compiling the final document. The process automatically scales based on character significance — major characters get comprehensive treatment across all phases, while supporting or minor characters can use early exit points for more efficient development. This structured approach allows for discoveries and adjustments throughout the process, making it ideal for characters requiring substantial depth.

### Generate

Provides tools for quickly creating specific story elements that can be incorporated into your larger work.

#### Scene Beats

Helps you break down a scene into manageable writing segments (scene beats) with detailed instructions for writing each beat. This mode guides you through planning, identifying narrative moments, organizing them into beats, and creating comprehensive instructions for each beat, helping bridge the gap between outlining and drafting.

#### Themes

Quickly generates theme concepts and implementation strategies in a single response based on available context. This one-turn interaction provides a complete theme document without extended collaboration, including primary and supporting themes, thematic tensions, symbolic representations, and practical implementation suggestions. The generated document is focused on application rather than excessive theory, organized to be immediately useful in your writing process. It's ideal when you need immediate thematic elements to work with or when you have a good idea of what you want but need it formalized quickly. Unlike the Planning (Theme Document) mode, this prioritizes efficiency over collaborative exploration.

#### Characters

Rapidly generates complete character profiles in a single response based on whatever information you provide. This one-turn interaction produces a finished character document without extended discussion, creating cohesive, believable characters with traits, background, personality, MBTI type, and narrative function that work together logically. The depth of the profile automatically scales based on the information provided and the apparent importance of the character, with more comprehensive profiles for major characters and streamlined versions for supporting characters. Unlike the Planning (Character Document) mode's phased approach, this mode fills in gaps thoughtfully when you provide minimal direction and is perfect for quickly developing characters when you need efficient creation rather than extended exploration.

### Chat

Provides conversational modes that help you engage with your story from different perspectives.

#### General

Offers general-purpose collaboration and assistance with any writing-related task. This mode maintains a conversational approach while providing feedback, suggestions, brainstorming, or other help as directed by you. It's versatile and adaptable to whatever specific focus you need within your creative process.

#### Character

Allows you to converse directly with a character from your story. The AI takes on the persona of your selected character, helping you understand their motivations, thoughts, and feelings through direct dialogue. This can provide valuable insights for character development and help overcome writer's block.

### Analysis

Provides critical examination of your writing from different angles to help improve your work.

#### Sarge

Offers tough-love feedback delivered by "Sergeant Write," a drill sergeant persona who provides blunt, honest, fair, and specific feedback with a military-style approach. This mode can be particularly motivating when you need direct criticism to identify and fix significant writing issues.

#### Editing

Provides a professional technical editing assessment focused on objective writing mechanics, clarity, and consistency. This mode identifies specific technical problems with clear solutions, from sentence-level issues to paragraph organization and formatting consistency.

#### Feedback

Offers an honest reader's perspective on your narrative, focusing on subjective elements related to storytelling craft, emotional impact, and reader engagement. This mode provides balanced feedback on both strengths and areas for improvement, helping you understand how readers might experience your work.

## Focus vs. Additional Entries vs. Additional Context

These three options control what information is included in the AI's context window when working with your story:

**Focus** selects the primary narrative element (scene, chapter, or act) you want to work on. This becomes the central context for the current session. For most Workshop modes, you'll want to select at least one Focus to provide the AI with the specific content you're currently addressing.

**Additional Entries** allows you to add relevant codex entries (character profiles, worldbuilding elements, magic systems, etc.) or snippets (brief notes) from your story bible. These provide essential reference information that helps maintain consistency and depth. For character-focused work, include that character's codex entry; for settings, include relevant location entries.

**Additional Context** lets you provide narrative text from other parts of your story beyond the Focus. This helps the AI understand connections between different story elements or maintain continuity. This is particularly useful when working on scenes that reference earlier events or when characters from previous sections reappear.

Use these options strategically to give the AI exactly what it needs without overwhelming it with irrelevant information. Different modes benefit from different types of context - character chats benefit from character codex entries, while analysis might need broader narrative context.

## Content Warning & NSFW Content

The Content Warning feature allows you to inform the AI about potentially sensitive content in your story, helping it respond appropriately to your requests.

When working with mature themes or NSFW content, adding a content warning serves several important purposes:

1. **Informed Context**: It provides the AI with clear understanding of your artistic intent and the mature nature of your work.

2. **Ethical Framework**: It establishes that your readers will have informed consent before encountering sensitive content, which helps certain AI models (particularly Claude) work more effectively with mature themes.

3. **Reduced Filtering**: It may prevent unnecessary content filtering when discussing sensitive but artistically valid topics.

A well-crafted content warning should:
- Briefly describe the mature elements present (violence, sexuality, etc.)
- Note the artistic purpose these elements serve
- Clarify that these elements are handled responsibly within the narrative
- Mention that appropriate reader warnings will be in place

For example: "This story contains scenes of graphic violence and psychological trauma as part of exploring themes of recovery and resilience. These elements are handled with care and sensitivity, and appropriate content warnings will be provided to readers."

This approach is especially important when working with AI models that have strong content filters but are designed to engage with mature artistic content when properly contextualized.

## Selecting Structures and Frameworks When Outlining

When using the Planning (Outlining) mode, you'll have the opportunity to select narrative structures and story frameworks that will guide your outlining process. These selections help adapt the AI's approach to fit your specific story type and creative vision.

When making these selections, consider:

1. **Story Length and Complexity**: Longer narratives may benefit from more detailed structures like the Hero's Journey, while shorter works might use simpler options like the Fichtean Curve.

2. **Character vs. Plot Emphasis**: Consider whether your story is primarily driven by external events (Plot Driven) or by internal journeys (Character Driven).

3. **Genre Expectations**: Different structures pair naturally with certain genres - Fantasy often works well with Hero's Journey, while Literary Fiction might benefit from Character Driven frameworks.

4. **Your Writing Style**: Choose structures that complement your natural storytelling approach rather than fighting against it.

5. **Flexibility Needs**: Remember you can always modify or combine structures - these are tools to support your creativity, not rigid rules.

The AI will help you implement your chosen structure while adapting to your specific needs, so don't worry about selecting "perfectly" - you can always adjust as your story develops.

### Narrative Structures

**Three Act Structure**: The classic beginning-middle-end structure with setup, confrontation, and resolution phases. Ideal for most story types and extremely adaptable. Best for stories with clear external conflicts and straightforward progression.

**Hero's Journey**: A mythic structure following a protagonist through call to adventure, trials, transformation, and return. Excellent for stories featuring physical and psychological journeys, especially in fantasy or adventure genres.

**Fichtean Curve**: A streamlined structure focusing on rising action through multiple crises leading to a climax and brief resolution. Ideal for fast-paced stories that need constant tension, like thrillers or mysteries.

**Mirror Structure**: Presents a character with similar situations repeatedly, each revealing more about their core nature. Best for character studies exploring growth through pattern recognition.

**Internal/External Parallel Structure**: Alternates between external events and internal processing, showing how outer experiences shape inner development. Great for balancing action with character growth.

**Relationship Network Structure**: Centers on how multiple relationships interact and influence each other. Ideal for family sagas, social dramas, or ensemble stories.

**Identity Spiral Structure**: Follows a character's deepening understanding of self through increasingly challenging situations. Perfect for coming-of-age or transformation narratives.

**Healing Journey Structure**: Organizes narrative around stages of recovery from trauma or emotional wounds. Excellent for stories centered on overcoming past damage.

**Parallel Journey Structure**: Adapts the Hero's Journey to focus on emotional and interpersonal milestones rather than physical challenges. Ideal for stories where emotional growth is the primary journey, giving mythic resonance to personal development.

**Internal Crisis Arc**: Adapts the Fichtean Curve to focus on psychological challenges rather than external conflicts. Best for stories driven by emotional tension with minimal external plot but high emotional stakes.

**Threshold Structure**: Organizes narrative around distinct moments of irreversible change or decision. Ideal for stories about transformation through decisive moments, particularly life changes or major decisions.

**Mirror Maze Structure**: Has characters encountering different reflections of themselves through others. Best for exploring self-discovery through relationships and parallels, using character interactions as mirrors.

**Deconstruction Structure**: Systematically breaks down a character's beliefs, certainties, or worldview. Particularly effective for stories about disillusionment or radical change in perspective.

**Pressure Cooker Structure**: Places characters in a confined situation where external pressures force internal issues to surface. Excellent for intense character studies in limited settings or timeframes.

**Echo Structure**: Organizes narrative around a significant past event that continues to resonate through the present. Best used when past events significantly influence present action or for stories exploring memory and history.

**Ripple Structure**: Follows the expanding consequences of a single action or choice. Ideal for exploring how individual choices affect communities and examining interconnection and causality.

**Mosaic Structure**: Tells a larger story through multiple independent but interconnected narratives. Perfect for complex stories requiring multiple perspectives on central events or themes.

### Story Frameworks

**Plot Driven Stories**: Focus on external events and challenges as the primary narrative drivers. Best for thrillers, adventures, mysteries, and action-oriented stories. This framework walks through developing premise, conflict, protagonist, theme, structure, plot threads, key scenes, and scene flow with a focus on external events.

**Character Driven Stories**: Center on internal journeys and relationship dynamics as the primary narrative forces. Ideal for literary fiction, romance, coming-of-age stories, and character studies. This framework guides you through developing character relationships, internal landscapes, social context, catalysts for change, relationship evolution, and key revelation scenes.

**Hybrid Stories**: Combine both approaches, with external journey mirroring or driving internal development, and character growth influencing plot outcomes. Suitable for complex narratives like epic fantasy, literary thrillers, or contemporary fiction with depth. This approach integrates both frameworks, ensuring developments in each area enhance the other.

When selecting a framework, consider your story's fundamental nature and what aspects you most enjoy exploring as a writer - the external challenges characters face, their internal growth, or a balance of both.
