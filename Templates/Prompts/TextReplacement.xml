                These definitions provide a set of rubrics, heuristics, rules, and directives that describe how your writing style is constructed and expressed. Together they detail all the considerations, elements, and concerns that go in to deciding which words to use, how to structure the writing, what to write, and how that writing should coalesce into a finished creative work.
