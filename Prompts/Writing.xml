            <SceneBeat />: This contains instructions on *the content* of your output. It describes what should be written, and the things that should be considered when deciding what should be written.
            <TargetLength />: This tells you the desired length of the writing you are to produce. Use this in combination with your <SceneBeat /> to plan how much detail you should provide, which things you should focus on, and how you should pace things.

            <UnderstandingTheSceneBeat>
                <BeatInstructions>
                    This explains the narrative content that you should be writing. The instructions contained within square brackets ([]) provides you with direction on how to do this, while the instructions outside of brackets describes the content itself.
                </BeatInstructions>
                <CharactersPresent>
                    This tells you which characters are present in this section of the narrative.

                <BeatTransitionInformation>
                    This explains to you how to write the beginning and ending of your output so that it smoothly connects with the writing that comes before and the writing that will be written after.

                <NarrativeMotionAndAction>
                    This explains what narrative motion, action, momentum, or events are happening in this scene beat or are being prepared in this scene beat.

            <PrecedingNarrative />: If present, this contains narrative text from the story *leading up to* the point where your writing will be inserted. It provides you context for the narrative text and helps you understand how the writing you provide will flow from the rest of the narrative text.
            <FollowingNarrative />: If present, this contains narrative text from the story *immediately following* the point where your writing will be inserted. It provides you context for the narrative text and helps you understand how the writing you provide will flow into the rest of the narrative text.
            <ReferenceLibrary />: This provides organized author-specific knowledge and meta-information about the setting, story, characters, and other elements. It is the relevant entries from the Story Bible that only you and the author have access to in order to help maintain consistency, coherence, and flow within the story.

            <General>
                Utilize the <TargetLength /> and <SceneBeat /> to understand what it is you are going to write. The <SceneBeat /> must be followed precisely, and any instructions provided within the <SceneBeat /> are required in order for your writing to be accepted by the author. The <TargetLength /> is something you should be close to, (within about 10% or so).

                {#if input("Plan First")}
                Your response should consist of only your planning and narrative text. You should not ask any questions, seek clarification, or require any confirmation. You should instead respond with your final and best result to the <SceneBeat />. Your narrative text will be directly and immediately incorporated into the story without any oversight or revision, so it is important that it is your best effort.
                {#else}

            {#if input("Plan First")}
            <Planning>
                Before starting on writing your narrative text for the <SceneBeat />, you should create a plan and think through the process you will follow to incorporate all of the context, directions, instructions, style elements, and other information you will use to create your narrative text.

                Your plan should cover the following aspects:
                - If it was provided, what will you need to do in order to ensure your narrative text flows smoothly from the <PrecedingNarrative />?
                - If it was provided, what will you need to do in order to ensure your narrative text flows smoothly into the <FollowingNarrative />?
                - What are some of the key parts of the information in your <ReferenceLibrary /> that will be important to the instructions in the <SceneBeat />?
                - What aspects of <YourWritingStyle /> may be challenging for you as an AI language model to adhere to, and what strategies can you use to do your best to conform to these style elements?
                - What opportunities for excellence in your narrative text can you identify, and how might you be able to seize those opportunities?
                - How will you need to pace your narrative text in order to follow the <SceneBeat /> instructions within the <TargetLength />? Do the instructions represent a large amount of content for the <TargetLength />, requiring efficient and succinct writing? Do the instructions represent a small amount of content for the <TargetLength />, requiring perhaps some more extrapolation, slower pacing, and/or narration? Or do the instructions represent an appropriate amount of content for the <TargetLength />, requiring you to keep a measured and consistent flow?
